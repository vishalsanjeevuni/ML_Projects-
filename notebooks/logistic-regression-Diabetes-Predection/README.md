# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to build a predictive model to identify the likelihood of diabetes based on various health metrics. The dataset includes features such as 'Glucose', 'BloodPressure', 'BMI', 'Age', and the target variable 'Outcome' indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.

## Steps Completed

### Data Loading and Cleaning
- Loaded the dataset from a CSV file.
- Identified and imputed missing and zero values for features using the median.

### Data Exploration and Understanding
- Analyzed the distribution of individual features through histograms.
- Used pairplots to visualize relationships between pairs of features.
- Examined correlations between features using a heatmap.

### Skewness Assessment
- Discussed the impact of skewness on model performance.
- Considered potential transformations to address skewness.

## Next Steps
- Apply necessary transformations to skewed features.
- Perform feature selection based on correlations and domain knowledge.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Experiment with various machine learning models.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
- Interpret and communicate model results.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
